# RPC-System-Architecture
Your task is to design and code the RPC system described above. You will design the application layer protocol to use. A skeleton is provided which uses a simple application programming interface (API). When we assess your submission, we will link our own testing code using the same RPC system API; what you will be assessed on is rpc
RPC System Architecture
Your task is to design and code a simple Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system using a client-server architecture.
The RPC system will be implemented in two files, called rpc.c and rpc.h. The resulting system can be linked
to either a client or a server. For marking, we will write our own clients and servers, and so you must stick to the
proposed API carefully.
For testing purposes, you may run server and client programs on the same machine (e.g., your VM).
